# RubiksCube-Solver-Python
A Python-based Rubik’s Cube solver built from scratch for the Collins Aerospace Design Dexterity Challenge. Uses custom data structures and logic to simulate valid cube moves and solve from any scrambled state — no external libraries used.
# 🧊 Rubik’s Cube Solver – Python Implementation

## 📌 Overview
An original Rubik’s Cube solver built entirely in Python, designed as part of the Collins Aerospace Design Dexterity Challenge 2025. This project models a 3x3 cube using a clean internal data structure and implements real-world move logic without using any third-party libraries.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Google Colab
- No external libraries
- Data Structures: Dictionaries, Lists

---

## 🧠 Features
- Simulates all valid Rubik’s Cube rotations: U, D, L, R, F, B and their inverses
- Uses a custom face representation model for easy manipulation
- Implements solving logic that mimics human solving steps
- Modular design makes the code adaptable for other cube sizes (2x2, 4x4)
- Console-based visual display of cube after every move

## 🧩 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RubiksCube-Solver-Python.git
   ```

2. Open the file in your environment:
   - Use `Niranjan_RubikSolver.ipynb` in Google Colab *(recommended)*
   - Or run `Niranjan_RubikSolver.py` in any Python 3 environment

3. Click Run All or execute cells step-by-step:
   - View the cube’s initial state
   - Apply scramble
   - Watch it solve step-by-step
